It’s time to take up arms to conquer demons - the realm’s, and your own!

In this  click-and-slash fantasy action adventure, you’ll collect colorful gems to power up each of three different classes, but there’s a twist - your class changes every 10 seconds!

Collect enough gems :gem: with each class and unlock your true power!
